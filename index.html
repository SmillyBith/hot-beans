  <img src="Office.jpg" div class="image3">  Our History <p>Hot Beans Web was set up in 2010 by Robert Davis because of his passion for web development. He decided to set up the business after he couldnâ€™t find anywhere to create his ideal website so he thought he could do it better. 

In 2013 Robert finally moved the business from a small office in Chobham to a bigger office in Farnborough business park which allowed Robert to expand the business and increase the amount of clients we have.

Now in 2023 Hot Beans Web works for several companies and provides the best experience possible. We are always looking to grow so check out the job openings to see if you can join the Hot Beans Web family. </p>
